      "content": "<p>Despite its CEO being barred from leaving France due to a criminal investigation, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/content/45029479/telegram-signal-copier-launches-version-5-1-with-powerful-new-features\">messaging platform <strong>Telegram</strong></a><strong> </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">TON</a>) is set to raise at least $1.5 billion through a new bond sale, according to a report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The funding round, expected to be finalized Wednesday, signals investor confidence in the platform's financial trajectory and user base, even as its founder, <strong>Pavel Durov</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/40893281/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-faces-10-year-sentence-and-500k-fine-in-frances-first-cybercrime-case-under\">faces legal scrutiny abroad</a>, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/telegram-set-to-raise-1-5-billion-in-bond-issue-despite-ceos-legal-woes-053284f0\">reported</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>French prosecutors have charged Durov preliminarily with failing to assist in investigations involving illicit activity, including child exploitation, on the Telegram platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Durov and the company maintain they've complied with all enforceable legal requests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We complied with all the binding legal requests we received. So up until this day, we don't understand what we did wrong,\" Durov said via video at a conference in Oslo on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bond, which carries a 9% yield and a five-year maturity, will allow investors the option to convert their holdings into Telegram shares at a discount should the company eventually go public. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a public listing appears unlikely in the short term, given market instability and Durov's current legal entanglements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proceeds will be used to retire Telegram's earlier debt, specifically, bonds issued in 2021 that mature next March. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/05/45616666/dogecoin-shiba-inu-and-other-meme-coins-are-entry-points-to-crypto-ecosystem-report\">Dogecoin, Shiba Inu And Other Meme Coins Are Entry Points To Crypto Ecosystem: Report</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telegram has already repurchased about $400 million worth of those bonds using available funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notable investors in the new bond issuance include returning stakeholders such as <strong>BlackRock </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BLK#NYSE\">BLK</a>) and Abu Dhabi's <strong>Mubadala</strong>, with new participants expected to include <strong>Citadel </strong>and other hedge funds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Durov had attempted to obtain permission to travel to the U.S. for meetings related to the deal but was denied by French authorities, who said the trip lacked sufficient justification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telegram's business, meanwhile, continues to expand rapidly. In March, the company reached 1 billion monthly active users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, Durov reported over 15 million paying subscribers, a figure that has doubled year-over-year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal indicate Telegram earned approximately $540 million in profit on $1.4 billion in revenue for 2024, a sharp turnaround from its $173 million loss on $342 million revenue in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2025, the company is forecasting over $700 million in profit on $2 billion in revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This financial growth is largely attributed to Telegram's expanding monetization tools, including digital in-app purchases, a growing bot ecosystem, and its advertising business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/05/45615233/michael-saylor-calls-proof-of-reserves-a-crypto-parlor-trick-but-binances-ex-ceo-cz-isnt-having-it-he-probably-sold-bitcoins\">Michael Saylor Calls Proof Of Reserves A &#8216;Crypto Parlor Trick&#8217;, But Binance&#8217;s Ex-CEO CZ Isn&#8217;t Having It: &#8216;He Probably Sold Bitcoins&#8217;</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>    ",

The semiconductor industry has faced increased volatility amid stricter U.S. chip export restrictions to China and the threat of new tariffs by President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>. <strong>Nvidia

been making significant investments in developing high-powered chip tools, such as the high numerical aperture (High NA) machines, for over a decade. The company&#8217;s high NA machines have been a key focus, with a price tag of over $400 million each. These machines are vital for the production of the most advanced chips, and ASML has been unable to sell them to China, which has further impacted the company&#8217;s potential sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in April, ASML&#8217;s shares took a hit after the company&#8217;s CFO,&nbsp;<strong>Roger Dassen</strong>, highlighted the potential impact of tariffs on the company&#8217;s performance in 2025 during an analyst call. In January, ASML CEO <strong>Christophe Fouquet </strong>told CNBC that he anticipates the company&#8217;s share of business in China will be lower in 2025 compared to 2023 and 2024 amid export restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, ASML remains positive about its growth opportunities in 2025 and 2026, with companies like&nbsp;<strong>Samsung</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Intel</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INTC#NASDAQ\">INTC</a>)&nbsp;investing in next-generation chipmaking tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a year-to-date basis, ASML stock climbed 8.05% to close at $756.79 on Tuesday.

Many firms are unable or reluctant to bear these costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, analysts note a shortage of qualified production workers. \"A meaningful increase in factory jobs does not appear likely in the foreseeable future, in our view,\" said <strong>Sarah House</strong>, senior economist at Wells Fargo. She highlighted that unpredictability surrounding government policy could further put firms off from hiring new workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/25/05/45616116/trumps-tariffs-may-trigger-an-inflation-shock-but-not-a-lasting-one-goldman-sachs-says\">Trump&#8217;s Tariffs May Trigger An Inflation Shock &#8211; But Not A Lasting One, Goldman Sachs Says</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Despite Trump's wide-ranging tariff measures, which are now at their highest level since the 1940s, as well as promises of corporate tax breaks, the ground reality is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts note that key tech firms like <strong><strong>Nvidia Corp.</strong> </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NVDA#NASDAQ\">NVDA</a>) and <strong><strong>Apple Inc. </strong></strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) have announced investments in U.S.-based facilities, but these high-profile cases are the anomaly, not the rule. Currently, the U.S. has 12.8 million industrial jobs, still millions less than the sector&#8217;s 1979 peak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Wells Fargo, even if every unemployed individual in the U.S. were recruited tomorrow, the workforce would still fall short by more than 14 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bank concludes that \"returning U.S. manufacturing employment to a level that remotely resembles its historical peak will be an uphill battle\", even as industry insiders warn that <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/tech/25/05/45613320/ai-is-gutting-entry-level-jobs-and-gen-z-is-paying-the-price-warns-linkedins-aneesh-raman\">AI is gutting entry-level jobs</a>, leaving Gen Z workers entering the workforce at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a survey published last month, <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/04/44880439/80-of-americans-say-the-country-would-be-better-off-with-more-manufacturing-jobs-but-only-25-want-one-themselves\">80% of Americans</a> said the country would be better off with more manufacturing jobs.

      "content": "<p><strong>Apple Inc. </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ\">AAPL</a>) accelerated its manufacturing pivot from China to India as U.S. iPhone shipments from the country jumped 76% year-over-year in April, reaching 3 million units.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> India&#8217;s iPhone exports to the U.S. soared 76% in April compared to the same period last year, according to data from Canalys, now part of Omdia. U.S. iPhone shipments from India reached approximately 3 million units, while Chinese shipments plummeted 76% to just 900,000 units over the same timeframe, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/indias-iphone-exports-to-the-us-soared-an-estimated-76percent-in-april.html\">reported</a> CNBC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The surge reflects Apple&#8217;s aggressive response to Washington&#8217;s tariff policies. iPhones imported from China face an additional 30% duty under current tariffs, while India faces the baseline 10% rate. President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> exempted consumer electronics from reciprocal tariffs on April 11, but maintained pressure on Apple to manufacture domestically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Le Xuan Chiew</strong>, Omdia research manager, noted Apple&#8217;s preparation for trade disruptions began during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company stockpiled inventory ahead of Trump&#8217;s April 2 tariff announcement, contributing to unusually high March shipments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/05/45636302/nvidia-amd-stand-to-gain-big-as-japan-proposes-about-7-billion-us-chip-deal-in-tariff-talks-report\">Nvidia, AMD Could Stand To Gain Big Time As Japan Proposes $7 Billion Chip Deal In Trump Tariff Talks Amid China Export Curbs: Report</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The shift positions Apple to navigate escalating trade tensions but faces significant challenges. Trump threatened a 25% tariff on all iPhone shipments Friday, demanding domestic manufacturing. <strong>JPMorgan</strong> analyst <strong>Samik Chatterjee </strong>maintains an Overweight rating, stating Apple is <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/25/05/45608580/apple-may-hike-iphone-price-but-well-positioned-to-eat-tariff-bite-says-analyst\">&#8220;well positioned&#8221;</a> to absorb tariff costs through modest price increases of approximately $50 per device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple recently <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/news/global/25/05/45582261/despite-trumps-warning-to-tim-cook-apple-moves-ahead-with-1-5-billion-india-expansion-via-foxconn-to-boost-iphone-production-report\">invested $1.5 billion through Foxconn </a>for display module production near Chennai, despite Trump&#8217;s criticism of Indian expansion. <strong>Ming-Chi Kuo</strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/25/05/45599817/apple-would-rather-absorb-a-25-iphone-tariff-than-move-production-to-the-us-says-analyst-no-guarantee-they-wont-face-repeated-tariff-threats-during-his-term\">argues that absorbing tariffs</a> remains more profitable than U.S. manufacturing relocation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>India <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/25/05/45599817/apple-would-rather-absorb-a-25-iphone-tariff-than-move-production-to-the-us-says-analyst-no-guarantee-they-wont-face-repeated-tariff-threats-during-his-term\">contributed 18% of global iPhone production in 2024</a>, projected to reach 32% in 2025, per Counterpoint Research.
